    Resources to build a disk image for each of the VEGA Pannotia workloads.
---

This folder and its subfolders contain each of the 9 Pannotia benchmarks (there are 6 folders because Color, and PageRank, SSSP each have 2 versions).  All of these benchmarks have been ported from the prior CUDA and OpenCL variants to HIP, and validated on a Vega-class AMD GPU.  See each application's README for details on how to compile and run them in gem5 using the VEGA GPU model.

## Compiling m5ops
To compile the m5ops:
```
cd gem5/util/m5
scons build/x86/out/m5
```
