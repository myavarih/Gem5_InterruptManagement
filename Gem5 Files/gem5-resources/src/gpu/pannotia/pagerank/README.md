PageRank (PR) is a graph analytics application that is part of the Pannotia benchmark suite.
It is an algorithm designed to calculate probability distributions representing the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links arrives at any particular page.
The provided version is for use with the gpu-compute model of gem5.
Thus, it has been ported from the prior CUDA and OpenCL variants to HIP, and validated on a Vega-class AMD GPU.

Compiling both PageRank variants, compiling the VEGA_X86/Vega_X86 versions of gem5, and running both PageRank variants on gem5 is dependent on the gcn-gpu docker image, `util/dockerfiles/gcn-gpu/Dockerfile` on the [gem5 stable branch](https://github.com/gem5/gem5).

## Compiling VEGA_X86/gem5.opt

PageRank is a GPU application, which requires that gem5 is built with the VEGA_X86 (or Vega_X86, although this has been less heavily tested) architecture.
The test is run with the VEGA_X86 gem5 variant, compiled using the gcn-gpu docker image:

```
git clone https://github.com/gem5/gem5
cd gem5
docker run -u $UID:$GID --volume $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:latest scons build/VEGA_X86/gem5.opt -j <num cores>
```

## Compiling PageRank
The Pannotia applications have been updated to use [m5ops](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/m5ops/).
To compile m5ops view the README.md in the parent directory, pannotia.

The docker command needs visibility to the gem5 repository for usage of the m5ops.
Thus we run the docker command from a directory with visibility and cd into the folder before running the make command.  
  
Note that Makefile.gem5-fusion requires you to set the GEM5_ROOT variable (either on the command line or by modifying the Makefile)  

PR has two variants: default and spmv.  To compile the "default" variant assuming the gem5 and gem5-resources repositories are in your working directory:

```
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:latest bash -c "cd gem5-resources/src/gpu/pannotia/pagerank ; make gem5-fusion"
```

To compile the "spmv" variant:

```
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:latest bash -c "cd gem5-resources/src/gpu/pannotia/pagerank ; export VARIANT=SPMV ; make gem5-fusion"
```

If you use the Makefile.default file instead, the Makefile will generate code designed to run on the real GPU instead.
By default, for both variants the Makefile builds for gfx902 and gfx900, and the binaries are placed in the src/gpu/pannotia/pagerank/bin folder.
Moreover, by default the VARIANT variable PageRank's Makefile assumes the csr variant is being used, hence why this variable does not need to be set for compiling it.


# Running PageRank on VEGA_X86/gem5.opt

Assuming gem5 and gem5-resources are in your working directory.
The following command shows how to run the PageRank default version:
```
wget http://dist.gem5.org/dist/develop/datasets/pannotia/pagerank/coAuthorsDBLP.graph
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:latest gem5/build/VEGA_X86/gem5.opt gem5/configs/example/apu_se.py -n3 --mem-size=8GB --benchmark-root=gem5-resources/src/gpu/pannotia/pagerank/bin -c pagerank.gem5 --options="coAuthorsDBLP.graph 1"
```

Assuming gem5, pannotia (input graphs, see below), and gem5-resources are in your working directory.
To run the PageRank spmv version:
```
wget http://dist.gem5.org/dist/develop/datasets/pannotia/pagerank/coAuthorsDBLP.graph
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} -u $UID:$GID ghcr.io/gem5/gcn-gpu:latest gem5/build/VEGA_X86/gem5.opt gem5/configs/example/apu_se.py -n3 --mem-size=8GB --benchmark-root=gem5-resources/src/gpu/pannotia/pagerank/bin -c pagerank_spmv.gem5 --options="coAuthorsDBLP.graph 1"
```

Note that the datasets from the original Pannotia suite have been uploaded to: <http://dist.gem5.org/dist/develop/datasets/pannotia>.
We recommend you start with the coAuthorsDBLP input for PR.
